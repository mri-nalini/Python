# Hi Guys! 
# Before we start with our python series,i Would like to tell you " Have a motto!"
# Yes guys, starting things can be easy but to be motivated for same continously is a real task 

# 3 things, i want you to do. 
# > have a "AIM", learning python for what (data science or data analytics)
# > Mention a time (under how many days,you would like to give yourself for completing it )
# > Learn everyday (1 hour a day, you should gift yourself.)
# > make a project 
# With this let's start :

## Basic arithmetic operations  * will take 2 Days
# Control and contional structures
# Looping- For, while loops 
# User input 
# strings
# Integers
# Floating Values 
# Typecasting
# This will take 2 Days 

# Focus on in-buit function data structures * will take 3 Days
#  > python strings and inbuit function
#  > python list and boolean variables inbuit function
#  > python sets- inbuilt functions
#  > python Dictionaries-inbuit functions
#  > python tuples- inbuit functions
#  > function in python  (imp)
#  > lambda Functions
#  > iterators and Generators
#  > Exception handling & imports Libraries

# OOPS- All you need  * Will take 4 Days  2hr per day 
# > classes
# > object
# > method
# > inheritance
# > polymorphic methods
# > data Abstraction 
# > Encapsulation 

# Libraries with python  * Will take 2 Days
# > numpy
# > pandas
# > matplotlib
# > seaborn 
# > Scipy 

# path towards specialization (flask, django,dask,pytorch,keras)
# > frameworks for web development (flask, django, web2py)
# > fremeworks for building desktop application 
# > further libraries for machine learning & deep learning
